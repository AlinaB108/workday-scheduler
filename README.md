# Workday Scheduler
A simple daily planer application which helps you to keep track of your events and save them for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm).

Tasks you add are stored in a local storage, so feel free to refresh/close your page without being afraid to lose your information.

Each block's color (gray, green, red) indicates whether the even is in the past, present or future.

## Usage
